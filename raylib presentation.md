# üîç Code Structure Overview

Raylib's source is divided into modules:

- `rcore`: Manages windows, input, and timing
- `rshapes`: Functions for drawing 2D shapes and handling collisions
- `rmodels`: Functions for handling and rendering 3D models
- `rtextures`: Manages image loading and texture manipulation
- `raymath`: Math utilities for vectors, matrices, and quaternions
- `raudio`: Handles sound and music playback
- `rgestures`: Detects touch gestures for mobile platforms

Each module typically has both `.h` and `.c` files that define public interfaces and internal implementations.

# üß± Data Types Used

### Structs
Used extensively to define core objects like:
- `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4` for spatial data
- `Rectangle`, `Color`, `Image`, `Texture2D`, `Model` for game assets

### Arrays
Used for:
- Vertices, textures, and image data
- Managing collections of game objects or renderable elements

### Enums
Used for:
- Defining constants (e.g., gesture types, texture formats, key codes)

### Pointers
Enable dynamic memory allocation and modular resource handling.

| Feature                        | Pros                                            | Cons                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Written in C**              | Fast, low-level control                         | Manual memory management, no OOP                     |
| **Modular design**            | Easy to understand and use separately           | Requires some boilerplate to set up each module      |
| **No GUI editors**            | Full control, clean API                         | No visual design tools                               |
| **Cross-platform support**    | Runs on many systems                            | Needs platform-specific builds/adjustments           |
| **Self-contained**            | No external dependencies by default             | Larger initial setup if extending functionality      |
